  // those local caches. This increases performance since users aren't
  // re-downloading the same resources every single page visit. This also allows
  // websites to have some (if not all) functionality offline! I highly
  // recommend reading up on ServiceWorkers on MDN before continuing.
  /*******************/
  // We first must register our ServiceWorker here before any of the code in
  // sw.js is executed.
  // B1. TODO - Check if 'serviceWorker' is supported in the current browser
  // B2. TODO - Listen for the 'load' event on the window object.
  // Steps B3-B6 will be *inside* the event listener's function created in B2
  // B3. TODO - Register './sw.js' as a service worker (The MDN article
  //            "Using Service Workers" will help you here)
  // B4. TODO - Once the service worker has been successfully registered, console
  //            log that it was successful.
  // B5. TODO - In the event that the service worker registration fails, console
  //            log that it has failed.
  // STEPS B6 ONWARDS WILL BE IN /sw.js
